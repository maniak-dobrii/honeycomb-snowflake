# â‰ˆ55mm (2.1in) radius, 4mm height

![How it looks](/screenshots/screenshot.png)

78 minutes print on my handmade prusa i3 with 25% fill, 70mm/sec speed, 0.1 layer hight. 

SketchUp file included, so you can easily scale or otherwise tweak before printing. Otherwise just throw .stl to your preferred slicer (I prefer Cura) and print. 

**Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**
